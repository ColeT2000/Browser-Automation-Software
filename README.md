Automates web browsers to fill in forms and create accounts.<br /> 
Automates the distribution of proxies to customers.

This browser automation software's main goal is to help users create multiple Nike accounts in a short period of time. 
It also consists of other functions, such as generating a large number of random names, addresses, and emails for users to fill in random particulars.
At some point, the software was considered one of the best in Southeast Asia and was widely used by many botters in the region.

Some of the important libraries used are: Pyppeteer, Asyncio, Threading, Pathlib, Colorma, Discord, Requests, OS, and many more.<br />
The software uses APIs from Nike, Stripe, and SMS providers.<br />
The software is coded mainly in Python.

# How it works
◼ The software can work with or without proxy input. Proxies allow users to mask their IP address to bypass security.<br />
◼ The command-line interface software will give users options to customise how they want their accounts to be created.<br />
◼ Users can also edit the settings nodepad to customise their accounts.<br />
◼ After users specify their requirements, the specified number of browsers will open to start generating accounts.<br />
◼ The process includes identifying various inputs such as email, name, password, and verifying a phone number.<br />
◼ Browsers will generate accounts in parallel for speed optimisation.<br />
◼ Once an account has been generated, the software will send a webhook notification to the Discord webhook link that the user has provided.<br />
◼ The task will be completed once the specified number of accounts is generated.<br />

As the software is currently being commercialised, the source code will not be provided.
Thank you for your understanding.
